<h2>Review: Basketball Dog(2018)</h2>
<img src="basketballdog.jpg" style="width:100%;height: 5%;">
<src="" alt=""/>
<p>4 out of 5 stars</p>
<p>From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball,and he's doggone good at it.</p>
<p>This movie has everything you could ask for:
<ul>
<li>Basketball</li>
<li>A dog</li>
<li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time. Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.</p>
